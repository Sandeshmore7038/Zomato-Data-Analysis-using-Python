# Zomato Data Analysis: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Using Python

This project focuses on analyzing restaurant data from Zomato, particularly from South India, to uncover patterns in customer preferences, 
restaurant distribution, and service availability. Using Python-based data analysis and visualization techniques, the project aims to derive 
insights that can help restaurant businesses and food delivery platforms make informed, data-driven decisions.

# Project Overview

The objective of this analysis is to explore and interpret the Zomato restaurant dataset to discover meaningful insights. The workflow involves:

Cleaning and preprocessing raw data for accuracy and consistency.

Engineering features to better categorize and understand the dataset.

Conducting detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns in cuisine choices, restaurant types, pricing, and ratings.

# Tools and Technologies

Python: Core language for analysis and visualization.

Pandas & NumPy: For data cleaning, manipulation, and transformation.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating clear, insightful visualizations.

Dataset: Zomato restaurant dataset (South India) sourced from Kaggle.

# Key Steps and Methodology
### 1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Dropped irrelevant columns such as address, phone, and url.

Treated missing and inconsistent values, especially in the rate column.

Converted cost values into numeric form for quantitative analysis.

Removed duplicate records to ensure data reliability.

### 2. Feature Engineering

Standardized and grouped similar restaurant types and location names.

Created new, simplified categories for clearer analysis (e.g., “others” for rare entries).

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

A series of visual and statistical analyses were performed to understand restaurant behavior and customer preferences:

Restaurant Distribution by Location:
BTM tops the list with the highest number of restaurants, while areas like Airport Nagar and St. Marks Road have the least.

Online Ordering & Table Booking Trends:
Most restaurants offer online ordering, but table booking services are less common.
Restaurants with both features generally have higher average ratings.

Location-Based Online Service:
BTM shows the strongest presence in online food delivery, whereas Shanti Nagar, Shivaji Nagar, and Commercial Street lag behind.

Popular Restaurant Types & Ratings:
“Pubs and Bars” perform well with an average rating of around 4.3, showing strong customer engagement.

Cuisine Preferences:
The top cuisines are North Indian, Chinese, and South Indian, reflecting regional tastes and preferences.

# Business Insights & Outcomes

This analysis highlights several valuable takeaways:

Customer Preferences: Identifies which cuisines and restaurant types attract the most customers.

Service Impact: Reveals how online ordering and table booking influence customer satisfaction and ratings.

Location Demand: Helps identify high-demand areas for new restaurant setups or delivery expansion.

# Conclusion

Through systematic cleaning, transformation, and analysis, this project provides a clear picture of the restaurant landscape in South India.
The insights generated can support restaurant owners, marketers, and investors in making strategic decisions based on data-driven evidence of consumer behavior and regional dining trends.
